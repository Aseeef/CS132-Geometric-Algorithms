\title{CS 132 -- Geometric Algorithms\\[0.25\baselineskip]Notes on Linear Algebra in Python}

\paragraph{Floating Point.}  This is just a reminder, that, as already discussed, real numbers are approximated in the computer using ``floating point'' format, which is in general a number that is close but not necessarily exactly equal to the real number of interest.   So, for example, it is not always true that \texttt{a - (b * (a/b))))} will be equal to zero when computed in Python.    

\paragraph{Linear Algebra in Python.} The linear algebra package we will use is \texttt{numpy.}  Always import it as
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
\end{verbatim}
Matrices will always be represented as \emph{numpy} arrays.   Some important functions:
\begin{verbatim}
np.array
np.shape
np.readtxt
np.savetxt
\end{verbatim}
Read the documentation on these before starting.  Later there will be more functions from numpy that we will use.  Get used to consulting the documentation!

A vector in \texttt{python} is a 1-D \texttt{numpy} array.
For example, here the vector \texttt{x} has been constructed from a list of floats:
\begin{verbatim}
x = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
\end{verbatim}

A matrix in \texttt{python} is a 2-D \texttt{numpy} array.  It behaves like a list of lists
that correspond to rows.    So you can construct a matrix like this:
\begin{verbatim}
A = np.array([[1.0, 2.0],[3.0, 4.0]])
\end{verbatim}

Thus \texttt{A[0][0]} (or \texttt{A[0,0]}) is
a single element of the array \texttt{A} (the element in the upper left
corner), while \texttt{A[0]} is the first row of \texttt{A}.  You can
also use a colon (\texttt{:}) to mean ``all indices.''  So another way
to get the first row of \texttt{A} is \texttt{A[0,:]}, and to get the
first column of \texttt{A}, you would use \texttt{A[:,0]}.

\paragraph{Numpy array types.} Numpy assigns a type to each matrix --
for example, \texttt{float} or \texttt{int}.  If you enter a matrix by hand into the
python interpreter, and all of the entries are integers, then numpy will
auto-detect this as an integer matrix.  When you assign values to an
integer matrix they will be rounded to the nearest integer.  This is \textbf{not}
what you want.  So you do \textbf{not} want to work with integer matrices in
general.  

So it is a good idea to make sure that the inputs your your functions are floating point matrices.
To convert an integer matrix to a floating point matrix you can simply
use:
\begin{verbatim}
A = A.astype(float)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Parameter Passing.}  Remember that parameter passing in \texttt{python} is by reference.   Thus if you pass an array into a subroutine, and modify the array in the subroutine, the modifications will still be in effect after the subroutine exits (i.e., modifying an array creates side-effects).

For similar reasons, if \texttt{A} is an array, the code \texttt{B = A} does not create a new array \texttt{B}, but rather results in both \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} pointing to the same array.   If you want to make an actual copy of an array or any object, use its \texttt{.copy()} method; i.e., write \texttt{B = A.copy()}.
